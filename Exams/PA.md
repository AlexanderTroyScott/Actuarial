:memo: Note: Unfortunately I have not had the time to go back and make additions to the predictive analytics exam information which I had summarized on my personal website.  

For this reason I decided to copy everything over to this github repository so that it could be better maintained by the community.


### 6. Generalized Linear Models

##### a) Implement ordinary least squares regression in R and understand model assumptions.

##### b) Understand the specifications of the GLM and the model assumptions. 
1. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares Regression)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Regularized Regression 
    * Ridge
    * Lasso
    * Elastic Net

###### Regularized Regression

##### c) Create new features appropriate for GLMs. 



##### d) Interpret model coefficients, interaction terms, offsets, and weights. 

See casact article

##### e) Select and validate a GLM appropriately.

##### f) Explain the concepts of bias, variance, model complexity, and the bias-variance trade-off. 

The more fit the model is to the training data, the less bias there will be; however, this tends to result in more variance in the testing data.

**Overfitting** - "Overfitting" to the training data resulting in **low bias, but high variance**

**Underfitting** - "Underfitting" to the training data resulting in **high bias, but low variance**

##### g) Select appropriate hyperparameters for regularized regression
